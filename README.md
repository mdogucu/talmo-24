## Abstract

Bayesian statistics is becoming more common in scientific practice and workforce. Thus, the inclusion of Bayesian training in statistics and data science curricula at the undergraduate level is more important than it has ever been. With the advances in computing power and modern educational tools, undergraduate Bayesian education is evolving. In this talk, we will cover the current state of Bayesian education at the undergraduate level in the United States. We will discuss different approaches and discover common themes in terms of content, software, and assessment in Bayesian classes.
